# Introduction to Next-Lite

Next-Lite is a lightweight, zero-dependency alternative to Next.js that prioritizes speed and simplicity. It provides a streamlined development experience while maintaining the essential features modern web developers need.

## What is Next-Lite?

Next-Lite is a React framework that enables you to build fast, modern web applications with React. It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easy to create production-ready applications.

Key features of Next-Lite include:

- **Zero Dependencies**: No external runtime dependencies for maximum reliability and security
- **Blazing Fast**: Built on esbuild, offering build times up to 100x faster than traditional bundlers
- **Minimal Footprint**: Tiny package size (15.9 kB) compared to Next.js (5+ MB)
- **File-Based Routing**: Intuitive routing based on your file structure
- **API Routes**: Create backend functionality within your Next-Lite application
- **CSS Modules**: Built-in support for component-scoped styles
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support out of the box

## Why Choose Next-Lite?

Next-Lite is designed for developers who want:

1. **Speed**: Faster builds, faster development cycles, and faster runtime performance
2. **Simplicity**: A framework that's easy to understand and reason about
3. **Reliability**: Fewer dependencies mean fewer potential issues
4. **Control**: More direct access to the underlying React mechanisms
5. **Lightweight**: A smaller footprint for better performance and lower resource usage
