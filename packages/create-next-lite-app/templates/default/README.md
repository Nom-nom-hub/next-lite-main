# Next-Lite App

This is a [Next-Lite](https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/next-lite-main) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-lite-app`](https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/next-lite-main/tree/main/packages/create-next-lite-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/next-lite-main/wiki/api-routes) instead of React pages.
